        "The Nitrox, DA’s most ferocious head to date, features the same quality construction as our other products with outrageous amounts of gain. The Nitrox adds more lows than DA’s other high gain amps, but remains insanely tight, which makes it perfect for uber-heavy rhythms and precision playing. The Nitrox also focuses heavily on thick, but smooth, upper mids to ensure it cuts through the mix with razor-sharp precision.",

      description:
        "The '65 Twin Reverb is a meticulous reissue of a true American classic. Whether your guitar has humbucking or single-coil pickups, this iconic 85-watt, all-tube combo amp serves up definitive clean tone that's perfect for rock, country, blues, jazz, fusion, and more. And it takes pedals splendidly. The Fender Twin is devastatingly loud. Spanking clean to around '8' on its volume dial, it can go toe-to-toe with any drummer onstage, but it speaks with authority at any volume — beautifully chimey, glassy, and full-throated. Sonically, the Fender Twin Reverb is based on their classic 1965 Blackface circuitry, and it delivers the legendary sound you've heard on countless hit records.",

      description:
        "The Granger G50 “Firestorm” valve amplifier is a high gain, single channel “hotrodded” supreme tone machine. Think of a modified Plexi, JCM800, or the “grail” of all tone, that late 70’s “brown sound” – you get the idea. What’s really interesting about the G50 is it’s dual role. Turn the Master Volume up and the Volume (gain) down, and you get a sweet, clean blues tone that is super responsive to the touch. Play lightly and the tone is soft and clean, but hit a note hard and it instantly jumps into liquid sustain and controllable feedback.",

      description:
        "All Valve, channel-switching amplifier with ultra-transparent effects loop and valve-driven reverb. The Rockerverb 100 MKII head utilises a two stage clean channel with a four stage dirty channel. The Clean Channel delivers a super rich clean tone with beautiful harmonic overtones. It is a non-master channel, much like vintage Orange amps, and when cranked the power section breaks up faster, delivering the most classic British crunch imaginable. The Dirty Channel has four stages of unadulterated filth, but it is NOT a one-trick pony. Move the Gain knob from 0 to 10, and as you do you’ll find a variety of Orange tones, from metal to fusion, rock to blues… there’s even some country in there.",
